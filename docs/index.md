# Welcome to Elfskot Docs

Elfskot provides two methods to integrate with our services. To get an impression of which data is available, [see the models page](models).

## REST API

Integrate or build your own application directly on our REST API. Integrating with our API gives more flexibility and control, but comes at the cost of being more complex to set up. If the integration is simple, e.g. syncing article data, it is recommended to use the SDK.

For more information about our API, see the [getting started with the API](api/start).

## SDK

Elfskot provides an easy way to integrate with our applications through our SDK. Our SDK has been developed in C#, and is available as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Elfskot.Connect.SDK/). 

For more information about our SDK, see the [getting started with the SDK](sdk/start).

## Custom configurator

There are several ways to embed the custom-facing configurator onto your existing website. 

If the website is built using WordPress we provide a simple plugin that allows you to embed the configurator directly onto a page. For more information click [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elfskot-product-configurator/).

You will also be able to create a new interface from scratch using our configuration endpoints. For more information see the [Tutorial: custom configurator](api/tutorial/custom configurator).

## Support
